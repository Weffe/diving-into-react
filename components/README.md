# Components

In React, you can break complex things down into smaller and smaller components. This allows for 2 big things: easier to manage complex apps and ability to reuse components.

Take for example these 2 following breakdowns:

<img src="./resources/imgs/component_breakdown_1.jpg" width="700" />

<img src="./resources/imgs/component_breakdown_2.png" width="450" />

As you can see an application can be broken down into smaller components. Imagine these components are like little Lego pieces and you can combine them in different ways resulting in a more complex Lego piece.
